# Low-code DAG catalogue

This repository contains a catalogue of pipeline resources designed to be highly reusable.

Each template is provided in a separate directory along with a `README.md`, a `metadata.yaml` and a `template.json.j2`. A directory can contain a pipeline and several versions.

<!--
Users can also contribute to the creation of new pipelines if they follow the template.
